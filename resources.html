  <h2> Resources for any project </h2>

This is where we'll compile all the resources we know about on a range of topics, including both tutorials from Bayes' Baes and those from other sources. I think we should format it like this:

<h5 id="r-basics"> Basics of using R for ecology </h5>

<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/" target="_blank">R for Data Science</a> - An excellent introduction on the basics of data management and plotting in R. Thorough, clear, and not condescending, this book is a MUST for anyone new to R or wanting to improve their workflow. Check out the *Explore* and *Wrangle* sections if you don't have time to go through the whole book!

<h5 id="figures"> Making beautiful figures </h5>

<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html" target="_blank">R for Data Science Chapter3</a> - Hadley Wickham's book is our top pick for understanding how to make figures in ggplot, which should come as no surprise - he created the package! <br>
<a href="https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html" target="_blank">gganimate Vignette</a> - This is a fabulous resource if you're interested in making animated plots - great for showing trends over time. <br>
<a href="https://nschiett.github.io/fishualize/index.html" target="_blank">Fishualize Documentation</a> - We might be biased because we're both marine ecologists, but the <span class="package-style">fishualize</span> package has some beautiful colour palettes based on different species of FISH! Don't see your favourite fish (because we know you all have one)? You can contribute palettes as well! <br>
<a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork" target="_blank">Patchwork Documentation</a> - <span class="package-style">patchwork</span> is probably the most intuitive package to create multi-panel ggplot objects without having to trial-and-error different values for your plot margins. <br>

<h5 id="lms"> Linear models (including LMMs, GLMs, and GLMMs) </h5>

<a href="https://github.com/seananderson/glmm-course" target="_blank">Sean Anderson's GLMM Course</a> - The holy grail for GLMMs. This course, designed by Sean Anderson, is the most comprehensive (free) course that's out there, with thorough explanations and examples with different link functions. Whether you're a newbie to GLMMs or a seasoned veteran, you're bound to learn something from this course! <br>
<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/228800/crossed-vs-nested-random-effects-how-do-they-differ-and-how-are-they-specified" target="_blank">Crossed vs. nested random effects</a> - If you've ever gotten confused about how to specify the types of random effects you have in your model, this surprisingly detailed Stack Exchange answer will help sort you out! 

<h5 id="bayes"> Bayesian! </h5>
<a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019" target="_blank">Statistical Rethinking</a> - This is a great intro to both the conceptual background behind Bayesian analyses and how to code them. McElreath's book is fantastic, but if you can't get your hands on a copy, he has his course materials here! <br>
<a href="https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/" target="_blank">Statistical Rethinking in brms</a> - If you liked Statistical Rethinking but wih you could see the examples coded in the more commonly used <span class="package-style">brms</span> package, you're in luck! A. Solomon Kurz goes through the entire book in this freely accessible Bookdown. <br>
<a href="http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/" target="_blank">Tidybayes Documentation</a> - <span class="package-style">tidybayes</span> is a great package with awesome documentation to help you figure out how to extract and plot outputs from a <span class="package-style">brms</span> model. <br>
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations" target="_blank">Prior Choice Recommendations</a> - Should you use uninformative or informative priors? Should they be weak or strong? Here is a great page to walk you through different priors and the pros/cons of each choice!

<h5 id="spatial"> Spatial stats in R </h5>
<a href="https://www.danaseidel.com/MovEco-R-Workshop/Materials/Day2/Spatial_Data_in_R/" target="_blank">Introduction to working with spatial data in R</a> - Here is a wonderful tutorial from the Hong Kong University Cetacean Ecology Lab, which gives a thorough introduction to using spatial data in R using the <span class="package-style">sf</span> package. 

<h5 id="misc"> Miscellaneous coding help </h5>
<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/index.html" target="_blank">Git and GitHub with R</a> - This is a great, comprehensive tutorial on how to install git, set-up GitHub, and get it all talking to RStudio. From beginning to end, you'll be pushing and pulling in no time!
