<h2>Helping biologsts get back to biology</h2>

These days, when studying biology, about 90% of our job seems to be doing stats (or thinking about stats, or Googling stats questions). The problem is, we're woefully underprepared for this reality in undergraduate biology programs and often need to spend an inordinate amount of time self-teaching in grad school. The problem is compounded by the fact that most established professors know very little about coding and dealing with the complexities of modern day statistics (ever been told by a supervisor to run a t-test even after explaining that your data don't meet the assumptions?). Students, post-docs, and ECRs are often left having to figure things out on their own by piecing together bits and pieces of things they've heard in class or learned from Stack Exchange.

Bayes' Baes was created to help centralize this information and reduce the need for frustrated Googling while running analyses. We cover a range of topics from basic coding and data cleaning skills to complex hierarchical analyses, helping you with every step of your project. While this resource will hopefully be useful for anyone looking to sharpen up their statistical and programming skills, it has been specifically collated to help grad students in ecology with the common pitfalls we face when working with data that rarely fit the assumptions of simple analyses. 

*We are not, and will never claim to be, real statisticians.* As such, our tutorials don't dive particularly deep into the math or theory underlying our analyses. Rather, we aim to provide the tools necessary to find the appropriate analyses for your data, code them, and understand the stats well enough to explain them to others (in particular your supervisor who doesn't think you should "overcomplicate" your model).
