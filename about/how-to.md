<h2>How to use this site</h2>

There are a few ways we'd recommend using this site, depending on what kind of support you need. Each tutorial has a set of tags and project types associated with it that will appear on the left hand side of the page when you open a post. **Tags** refer to the topic or subtopic covered in a post (e.g., "data cleaning" or "fundamentals"), while **project types** refer to common analyses that a given tutorial may be useful for (e.g., "generalized linear modelling" or "mixed effects models").

In the **Tutorials** section of our website, you'll see all of our available tutorials organized by these two identifiers. If you are working on a certain type of project, head to the [Browse By Project](https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/browse-by-project/) tab to see what tutorials we have available for your type of analysis. In this section, we link to bite-sized tutorials that will be useful for every part of the process. Rather than a single tutorial for how to run a generalized linear model, for instance, you'll find a set of tutorials on data cleaning, workflow, linear models, non-normal distributions, interactions, and how to read GLM output in R. If you are interested in all of the tutorials we have available on a specific topic (e.g. data cleaning), head to the [Browse By Tag](https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/browse-by-tag/) tab. Finally, if you'd just like to browse, you can select the [Browse All](https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/browse-all/) tab to look through all of our posts. You can also use the [Search](https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/search/) tab to search our collection.
