<h2>How to use this site</h2>

There are a few ways we'd recommend using this site, depending on what kind of support you need:

**Tutorials**

If you'd like to browse our collection of tutorials written by us and the Guest Baes, you can select the [Browse All](https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/browse-all/) tab in the **Tutorials** section of our site to look through all of our posts. Each tutorial has a set of tags associated with it that will appear on the left hand side of the page when you open a post. **Tags** refer to the topic(s) or subtopic(s) covered in a post (e.g., "data cleaning" or "fundamentals").If you are interested in all of the tutorials we have available on a specific topic (e.g. data cleaning), head to the [Browse By Tag](https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/browse-by-tag/) tab.  You can also use the [Search](https://bayesbaes.github.io/search/) tab to search our collection.

Most of our tutorials cover individual components of larger topics. So, rather than a single tutorial for how to run a generalized linear model, for instance, you'll find a set of tutorials on data cleaning, workflow, linear models, non-normal distributions, interactions, and how to read GLM output in R. 

**Other resources**

If you are working on a certain type of project, you can also head to the [Resources](https://bayesbaes.github.io/resources/) tab to see both the tutorials that we have available AND additional resources that we've found helpful for our own work. In this section, we link to a range of useful sites including online books, package vignettes, tutorials, or in some cases *really* well explained Stack Overflow answers. This is an ever-growing list so please feel free to send us other resources you've found to be useful!
