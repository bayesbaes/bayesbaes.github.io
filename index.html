<h5> Welcome to the Bayes' Baes Blog! We're ecologists helping other ecologists spend more time doing ecology and less time learning stats. </h5>

We created this blog to help early career researchers navigate the quantitative underbelly of ecology. Here, you’ll find tutorials that we’ve created covering most of the statistical and R-coding techniques that the typical grad student will have to face. We’ve also compiled a number of helpful resources that other people, who are much smarter than us, have already created. Did we miss something? Want to contribute as a Guest Bae? Get in touch!

Bayes' Baes was started by two PhD students based in Vancouver and Townsville studying the ecology of marine ecosystems who have an arguably unhealthy love for stats and coding. This resource wouldn't be possible without contributions from many other - much smarter - ecologists. You can read about the team below.
