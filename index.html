Welcome to the Bayes' Baes Blog! We're ecologists helping other ecologists spend more time doing ecology and less time learning stats. <br>

We created this blog to help early career researchers navigate the quantitative underbelly of ecology. Here, you’ll find tutorials that we’ve created covering most of the statistical and R-coding techniques that the typical grad student will have to face. We’ve also compiled a number of helpful resources that other people, who are much smarter than us, have already created. Did we miss something? Want to contribute as a Guest Bae? Get in touch!

Getting started:
Are you looking for some helpful resources like online courses and R packages? Check out the <a href="https://bayesbaes.github.io/resources/">Resources</a> tab. 

Are you looking for specific topics like what the G in GLM is or what the intercept in your model means? Check out the <a href="https://bayesbaes.github.io/tutorials/browse-all/">Tutorials</a> tab, where you can search by keyword or browse through the collection.

Who are we? We are two PhD students based in Vancouver and Townsville studying the ecology of marine ecosystems who have an arguably unhealthy love for stats and coding. Click <a href="https://bayesbaes.github.io/people/">here</a> to learn more about the Founding Baes and our Guest Baes.
