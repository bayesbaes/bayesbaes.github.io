## Resources for any project

This is where we'll compile all the resources we know about on a range of topics, including both tutorials from Bayes' Baes and those from other sources. I think we should format it like this:

##### Basics of using R for ecology

<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/" target="_blank">R for Data Science</a> - An excellent introduction on the basics of data management and plotting in R. Thorough, clear, and not condescending, this book is a MUST for anyone new to R or wanting to improve their workflow. Check out the *Explore* and *Wrangle* sections if you don't have time to go through the whole book!

##### Making beautiful figures

<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html" target="_blank">R for Data Science Chapter3</a> - Hadley Wickham's book is our top pick for understanding how to make figures in ggplot, which should come as no surprise - he created the package! <br>
<a href="https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html" target="_blank">gganimate Vignette</a> - This is a fabulous resource if you're interested in making animated plots - great for showing trends over time.

##### Linear models (including LMMs, GLMs, and GLMMs)

<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/228800/crossed-vs-nested-random-effects-how-do-they-differ-and-how-are-they-specified" target="_blank">Crossed vs. nested random effects</a> - If you've ever gotten confused about how to specify the types of random effects you have in your model, this surprisingly detailed Stack Exchange answer will help sort you out! 

##### Bayesian!
<a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019" target="_blank">Statistical Rethinking</a> - This is a great intro to both the conceptual background behind Bayesian analyses and how to code them. McElreath's book is fantastic, but if you can't get your hands on a copy, he has his course materials here! <br>
<a href="https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/" target="_blank">Statistical Rethinking in brms</a> - If you liked Statistical Rethinking but wih you could see the examples coded in the more commonly used <span class="package-style">brms</span> package, you're in luck! A. Solomon Kurz goes through the entire book in this freely accessible Bookdown. <br>
<a href="http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/" target="_blank">Tidybayes Documentation</a> - <span class="package-style">tidybayes</span> is a great package with awesome documentation to help you figure out how to extract and plot outputs from a <span class="package-style">brms</span> model. 
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations" target="_blank">Prior Choice Recommendations</a> - Should you use uninformative or informative priors? Should they be weak or strong? Here is a great page to walk you through different priors and the pros/cons of each choice!

##### Spatial stats in R
<a href="https://www.danaseidel.com/MovEco-R-Workshop/Materials/Day2/Spatial_Data_in_R/" target="_blank">Introduction to working with spatial data in R</a> - Here is a wonderful tutorial from the Hong Kong University Cetacean Ecology Lab, which gives a thorough introduction to using spatial data in R using the <span class="package-style">sf</span> package.
