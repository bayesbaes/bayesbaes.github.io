## Resources for any project

This is where we'll compile all the resources we know about on a range of topics, including both tutorials from Bayes' Baes and those from other sources. I think we should format it like this:

##### Basics of using R for ecology

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank"} - An excellent introduction on the basics of data management and plotting in R. Thorough, clear, and not condescending, this book is a MUST for anyone new to R or wanting to improve their workflow. Check out the *Explore* and *Wrangle* sections if you don't have time to go through the whole book!

##### Making beautiful figures

[R for Data Science Chapter3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html){:target="_blank"} - Hadley Wickham's book is our top pick for understanding how to make figures in ggplot, which should come as no surprise - he created the package!\
[gganimate Vignette](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html){:target="_blank"} - This is a fabulous resource if you're interested in making animated plots - great for showing trends over time.
