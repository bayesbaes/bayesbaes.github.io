## Resources for any project

This is where we'll compile all the resources we know about on a range of topics, including both tutorials from Bayes' Baes and those from other sources. I think we should format it like this:

##### Basics of using R for ecology

<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/" target="_blank" style="color:#0086b3;">R for Data Science</a> - An excellent introduction on the basics of data management and plotting in R. Thorough, clear, and not condescending, this book is a MUST for anyone new to R or wanting to improve their workflow. Check out the *Explore* and *Wrangle* sections if you don't have time to go through the whole book!

##### Making beautiful figures

<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html" target="_blank" style="color:#0086b3;">R for Data Science Chapter3</a> - Hadley Wickham's book is our top pick for understanding how to make figures in ggplot, which should come as no surprise - he created the package! <br>
<a href="https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html" target="_blank" style="color:#0086b3;">gganimate Vignette</a> - This is a fabulous resource if you're interested in making animated plots - great for showing trends over time.

##### Bayesian!
<a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations" target="_blank" style="color:#0086b3;">Prior Choice Recommendations</a> - Should you use uninformative or informative priors? Should they be weak or strong? Here is a great page to walk you through different priors and the pros/cons of each choice! 


##### Spatial stats in R
<a href="https://www.danaseidel.com/MovEco-R-Workshop/Materials/Day2/Spatial_Data_in_R/" target="_blank" style="color:#0086b3;">Introduction to working with spatial data in R</a> - Here is a wonderful tutorial from the Hong Kong University Cetacean Ecology Lab, which gives a thorough introduction to using spatial data in R using the sf package.
