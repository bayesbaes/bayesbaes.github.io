Here's where you'll write your blurb. And here's how to add a picture:


<div class="container">
  <img src="/assets/images/your_photo_file_name.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
</div>



Follow the template above for your author bio (make sure to view it as Raw to see the proper syntax), and see our site for examples. You can do this all directly on Github by creating a branch from our repo, going to the *_authors* folder, selecting *Add file -> Create new file*, then naming your bio firstname_lastname.md (please make sure to have the .md extension!).

You are welcome to link to your personal site/Github/Twitter in your bio if you'd like using the following syntax:

[square brackets around what you want the hyperlink to say](parentheses around the url)

Ex: [My twitter](https://twitter.com)
