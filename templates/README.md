If you'd like to contribute a tutorial to Bayes' Baes, please get in touch with us (we may be working on a similar post!) and then use the templates included in this folder to streamline the process for us before creating a pull request. If you are unfamiliar with Github but still want to contribute please let us know in your email and we'd be happy to help.

**Post**: For your actual post, feel free to create it using whatever software you prefer and export to a .md or .html file. For your post to display properly on our site, you'll need to add front matter to your file, which is very easy! If you have it uploaded to your personal account or to a fork of our repo, you can manually edit it in the text viewer through Github. Simply add three dashes at the top of your file, then the information included in the *post_template.md* file in this folder, then another three dashes below that. Please follow the naming convention indicated in the *post_template.md* file. When completing a pull request, make sure to add this to the _posts folder in our repo.

**Author Photo**: We like to feature all of our Guest Baes on our About page! Please upload a photo of yourself in the *assets/images* folder.

**Author Info**: Please write a little blurb about yourself to include on our site, following the *author_template.md* file in this folder. When completing a pull request, make sure to add this file to the *_authors* folder of our repo.

Note, if this is not your first contribution, there's no need to upload an additional photo and bio, just make sure to follow the naming convention you used in previous posts when writing the front matter for a new post.
