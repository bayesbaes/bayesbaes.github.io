## Become a contributor

If you'd like to contribute a tutorial to Bayes' Baes, please get in touch with us (we may be working on a similar post!) and then use the templates included in this folder to streamline the process for us before creating a pull request. If you are unfamiliar with Github but still want to contribute please let us know in your email and we'd be happy to help.

**Post**: For your actual post, feel free to create it using whatever software you prefer (we use RMarkdown and will be able to provide support if you also use it!) and export to a .md file. For your post to display properly on our site, you'll need to follow specific naming conventions and have the correct front matter, as explained in the *post_template.md* file. When completing a pull request, make sure to add this to the *_posts* folder in our repo and your image folder (if you have one) to our *figures* folder.

**Author Photo**: We like to feature all of our Guest Baes on our About page! Please upload a photo of yourself in the *assets/images* folder.

**Author Info**: Please write a little blurb about yourself to include on our site, following the *author_template.md* file in this folder. When completing a pull request, make sure to add this file to the *_authors* folder of our repo.

Note, if this is not your first contribution, there's no need to upload an additional photo and bio, just make sure to follow the naming convention you used in previous posts when writing the front matter for a new post.

The easiest way to contribute directly to our site is to create a branch of our repo in your own directory, add your post, photo, and bio to the appropriate folders, then create a pull request to push your files to our repo. Follow the same steps to create any changes to tutorials you've already pushed to our repo.
